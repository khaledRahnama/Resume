      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer with a multidisciplinary background and over 15 years
        of experience across electronics, software development, and AI. My
        academic journey includes an ASc in Electronics, a BSc in Software
        Engineering and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence, which have
        supported my ability to work on diverse projects in both hardware and
        software domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my career as an Electronics Technician, diagnosing and
        repairing various systems like household appliances and CNC machines.
        Later, I worked as a Field Engineer, maintaining and troubleshooting
        non-destructive testing (NDT) equipment. My experience also includes
        designing electronic devices, developing custom AVR boards, and
        integrating hardware with software as part of my role as a Software
        Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to electronics, I’ve contributed to software projects,
        including developing applications with various technologies, creating
        intuitive user interfaces, and implementing RESTful APIs. I also have
        experience in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and
        statistical analysis for market behavior studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new technologies. With
        my broad experience and adaptability, I aim to bring value to teams
        tackling challenges in technology, innovation, and development.
